# Using in your project

grafix_toolbox is a collection of my personal tools.

If you found this crate of your own accord you'll probably be interested in the GUI capabilities.

See ./gui/elements for my premade elements, and see the rust-demo on my github to see an example of usage.

./gui/parts contains parts to build gui elements - namely colored rectangle, line of text, sprite, 9sprite and and an sdf 9sprite.

For my utilities you can explore from lib/mod.rs
